# AccelerationGame
This is a .NET project using WPF.
In this game you are speeding on the highway, and you have to catch as many fuel cans as you can, before your fuel runs out.
Note that it will be harder and harder to catch them as you are accelarating.
You can switch lanes to the left or to the right with the arrow keys or the 'a' or 'd' keys.
